1. geometry_CoPc-substrates: Optimized geometries of Co-phthalocyanine (CoPc) adsorbed on good metal Cu(111), semi-metals Sb(111) and Bi(111), and half-metal CrO2(110) at top, hcp, fcc, and bridge sites. 
2. CoPc-Bi111-topology: Input files for the calculations of topological properties. 
3. First-principles calculations were performed by the vasp code. The topological indices of CoPc/Bi(111) were calculated by the Z2Pack code, and the topological edge states were calculated by WannierTools in combined with the Wannier90 code.
